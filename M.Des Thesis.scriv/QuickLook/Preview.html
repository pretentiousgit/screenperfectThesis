- Swarm. I could build swarm. <br/>
— Swarm is an array of mechanical critters that try to attract, then repulse attention.<br/>
— This would involve sorting out how people pay attention, and if they do; they mainly don’t.<br/>
- Emma would like me to continue work on psXXYborg, which would result in the psXXYborg system being released; nodeJS/websockets to control a projection of video, but I would rather make an app tha...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Conclusion</strong><br/>The work that has gone into the production and release of screenPerfect is not inconsiderable. As a creative project based in grounded theory and reflective practice, code is a tricky thing to pin down; it must be declarative, yet reveals the internal architecture of the people who write it. To write code is to be a craftsperson, and to be a craftsperson is to reveal some of yourself with every stroke of the plane. <br/>
The tools themselves, though, are a concern. Programming solo is as rewarding as...</p>

 This article investigates gender essentialism from the perspective of biological essentialist arguments frequently used to say women can’t or shouldn’t code because of various, entirely specious, evolutionary problems. This is an argument that happens on top of a perceived resource scarcity; the scarcity is in this case employment of women in technology, so opportunity.<br/>
