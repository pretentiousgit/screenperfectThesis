five things from last week

- ask questions and present a way in to the work
- provide a demo to my instructors
- Apply to various conferences because no-one knows what they're doing
- this is super advanced, there's a lot of theory, it's okay if it fails
- sadly, it's so advanced everyone thinks it's incomprehensibly insane
- but then google's chromecast happened? I may be obsolete. :<
- Everything has been disastrous but now it mostly works.

- this is a private piece of public space.
- make a video of someone coming in and pairing to the computer with the label and the video content.
- connect to it get the video content.
- storyboard or diagram format
- need to use the tent that holds media content - label it. Photographs and physicality. The step by step user experience is what is important.
- Go to AGO and film someone pairing to the network.
- Find a slightly crappy linux computer that can stand in for a pi.
