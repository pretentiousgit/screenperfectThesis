	My initial approach is to pair with an artist who had a game idea, take that idea, and then make it reproducible. Reproduction is, after all, the province of cyborgs: we control our biological systems, and in doing so, we have conquered what was once a hard-built destiny. By making the consequences of biological sex into a more pliant construct of gender, we have transformed what we must be to what we might be.
