% A brief section giving background information may be necessary, especially if your work spans two or more 
% traditional fields. That means that your readers may not have any experience with some of the material 
% needed to follow your thesis, so you need to give it to them.

\section{Existing Software}
ScreenPerfect does not exist in a void. Although written fresh in Javascript, it is dependent on many frameworks and libraries in order to work. The code was developed using the Node framework for Javascript on the server, which is supported by Google. It mimics functionality produced by the Dataton Watchout system, which provides simultaneous video windows using a custom, private hardware platform. The software that screenPerfect interacts best with is Google Chrome.

\subsection{Twine}
Twine is a branching narrative platform which relies on the user to download software to their local machine. The user can then produce a narrative that branches in a conventional browser window. This software was popularized by indie gaming celebrity Anna Anthropy in her 2012 book Rise of the Videogame Zinesters \cite{anthropy}. 


\subsection{Game Engines: What Are They?}
