\section{Problems and Complications}

In this section, I address issues with the format of ScreenPerfect games. I also address the problems of accessibility in tools, including the issue of avocatonal versus vocational creative practice.

\subsection{Problems with CYOA as a format}

* People want the full achievement
* There is a huge pressure on creators for consistency in order to bring out catharsis and etc.
* This is super tough in a CYOA because by definition, it's not a one-playthrough thing with accomplishments.

%	Amateurs don't make money, almost by definition
%-----------------------------------

\subsection{Avocational Work versus Professionalisation}

* We currently live in a money-based system and need to earn it via our work.
* The easier it is to make a game, does this reduce the percieved value of the game itself
* Puts weight on the object that distributes the experience.
