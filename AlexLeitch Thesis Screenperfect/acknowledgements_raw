I wish to express my appreciation to my thesis advisors, Emma Westecott and Simone Jones, without whose generous contributions of time, smarts, and book suggestions this would be a much weaker paper. I would also like to express gratitude to the Site 3 coLaboratory community, who provided me space to work and a community to work with, and Bento Miso - Dann Toliver, Jennie and Henry Faber expressly - for their technical advice and their help in hosting the jams. I would also like to extend my thanks to Evan of the Digital Futures tech desk for a key pointer when I was just starting my research. Hannah Epstien deserves my thanks as well for being a fantastic collaborator for two years of video research projects.

I would also like to extend my gratitude to my informal communities, for their patience with me as I exited social life for academia for two years. To my personal support network, many thanks, this includes my mother, Nola McConnan, for her lifelong determination and advocacy for the role of the technician in the arts, Kathryn Halloran for editing even quite unfinished text, and Adina Bogert O'Brien for unflagging belief in the value of my work.
