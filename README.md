This is a thesis repo for an MRP - a Major Research Paper - in defence of a Master's of Design.

The most relevant file you will need to read is:

This project is backed up here because I used it to learn LaTeX along with JS and Debian Linux. None of that documentation is super important for a thesis paper, however, so it is mainly stored in the appendices.

Mechanism: An artist-led, feminist design pattern for open technology tools.  
by Alex Leitch  
20th March 2014  

This thesis examines what it means for technology to open, and how that open technology
may be applied in support of the arts. Drawing on Hélène Cixous' "Laugh of the Medusa",
the paper proposes a feminist, inclusive design process that subverts imposter syndrome by
involving community engagement in the software development process, then uses that method
to develop software that powers narrative-focused FMV video games using Node.JS internet
technologies.

In the first part of this paper presents an artist-led technical collaboration to produce sample
software that repeats and extends a specifi artistic practice. The sample software described
allows artists to assemble and install branched video narratives for exhibition using web technologies served over Linux on the not-for-profit Raspberry Pi platform.

The second part of this paper tests the expansion and development of this software prototype
via a type of voluntary design charette known as a game jam, during which participants use the
software to build their own FMV experience. The game jam is pursued with inclusive, feminist
intent, and is hosted by the Dames Making Games with technical collaboration from Bento Box
on further software development.

The third stage of the design method discusses the public display and distribution of the software
on a not-for-profit hardware platform called the Raspberry Pi, which permits low-cost and lowimpact
display of the custom games. This stage includes discussion of realistic design constraints
for new media installations. The intent of hardware development is to permit artist control over
the context of their work, while allowing use of contemporary software capabilities in developing
what the future of such work might be.
