This is a thesis repo for an MRP - a Major Research Paper - in defence of a Master's of Design.

The most relevant file you will need to read is:

This project is backed up here because I used it to learn LaTeX along with JS and Debian Linux. None of that documentation is super important for a thesis paper, however, so it is mainly stored in the appendices.

Mechanism: An artist-led, feminist design pattern for open technology tools.  
by Alex Leitch  
20th March 2014  

This thesis examines what it means for technology to open, and how that open technology may
be commodified in support of the arts. Drawing on Hélène Cixous’ ”Laugh of the Medusa”,
I propose a feminist, inclusive design method that subverts imposter syndrome by involving
community engagement in the software development process, then uses that method to develop
software that powers narrative-focused FMV video games using Node.JS internet technologies.

The sample software described allows artists to assemble and install branched video narratives
for exhibition using web technologies served over Linux on the not-for-profit Raspberry Pi
platform. It was developed through the twin working practices of open software design and
artistic collaboration, and tested with a community user base via a type of voluntary design
charette known as a game jam. The system can potentially be expanded using a Dropbox-like
capability to update new media art projects remotely from a studio when an external internet
connection is available, while not requiring that internet connection to serve a web application
to a user’s phone over a local wireless access point. This permits artists control over the context
of their work, while allowing use of contemporary software capabilities in developing what the
future of such work might be.
